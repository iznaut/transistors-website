Transistors is a support group for trans adults aged 18 or older. Included in this umbrella are trans, questioning, and allies; but with an emphasis on listening to trans and questioning voices first.

No attendance requirements, come and go as one pleases. Salty language allowed.

Our group meets every other Wednesday from 6-8pm at the Close House in Iowa City. Please check out the <a href="{{ '/events/' | url }}">Events page</a> for more information about upcoming meetings.
